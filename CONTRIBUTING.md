## Contributing to this project

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

<ol>
  <li>Fork the repo and create your branch from master.</li>
  <li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
  <li>If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.</li>
  <li>Ensure the test suite passes.</li>
  <li>Make sure your code lints.</li>
  <li>Issue that pull request!</li>
</ol>
